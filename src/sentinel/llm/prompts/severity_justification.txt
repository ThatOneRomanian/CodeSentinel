Justify the severity level for the following security finding:

Rule: {{rule_id}}
Severity: {{severity}}
File: {{file_path}}
Line: {{line}}
Excerpt: {{excerpt}}
Language: {{language}}
Category: {{category}}
Tags: {{tags}}

Provide:
1. Rationale for the assigned severity level (low, medium, high, critical)
2. Factors that influence the severity (e.g., exploitability, impact, scope)
3. Comparison to similar security issues
4. Context-specific risk factors

Additional Context:
- Consider the token/provider classification when assessing severity
- Test vs production indicators may affect risk level
- Provider-specific implications should be factored in

Be objective and evidence-based in your justification.
